					<h1>Preliminary Clinical results based on patient interviews</h1>

					
					<p>Optimising therapeutic RSO use can be a challenge for doctors as well as patients. Most physicians never learned about RSO in medical school and, according to a 2017 survey, few feel they are qualified to counsel patients about dosage and usage of such products. To assist anyone in search for more information, we conducted our own clinical study to investigate the effects of RSO products on various health condition.<br>
					The main purpose of this study was to understand the effects of short and long term RSO usage and help to improve future derived products.<br><br>
					The preliminary results were obtained from 135 patients from 8 different European countries that have filled an evaluation form about their use and experiences of RSO products.<br><br>
					
					<b>Health Conditions researched</b><br><br>

					Patients who involved in this research had a wide range of health conditions. Related health conditions were combined as one group to allow a better fitting result. As such, all cancer types were combined into one group, this applied also for patients that indicated to use RSO to ease pain due to cancer. Other patients indicated to use RSO for various types of pain relief or chronic pain, therefore, all causes of pain (with the exception of cancer) were combined into another group. Patients that indicated to have suffer from depression, stress and/or anxiety were also placed as one health condition group.<br><br>

					Cancer was found to be the present for the largest part of the patients (26,4% or 29 patients), followed by pain (16,4% or 21 patients) and depression, stress and/or anxiety (14,5% or 16 patients) as seen in figure 1.<br><br>

					Furthermore, 7,3% of the patients used RSO for multiple sclerosis, 6,4% used it for sleeping problems like insomnia, 5,5% used it for fibromyalgia. Other users indicated to have used RSO products for arthritis, epilepsy, diabetes, neuropathy, spinal disorders, migraine, COPD, PTSD, Lyme, Crohn's disease, bronchitis, recreational use, sexual stimulation and more.<br><br>

					<p>
					<i>Figure 1. Use of RSO products for health conditions or reasons</i><br><br>

					<b>Effects of usage?</b><br><br>

					Patients were asked to indicate whether the RSO products that they used for their health conditions did satisfy their expectation.<br><br>

					A staggering amount of 83,9% of the patients indicated that RSO products indeed did satisfy their expectations to use it for their health condition. 12,9% was not sure and 3,2% indicated that it did not met their expectations (see figure 2).<br><br>

					<i>Figure 2. Expectations of RSO products from all patients.</i><br><br>

					78,6% of the 29 cancer patients that participated in this research indicated that the RSO products satisfied their expectations, while 21,4% did not know if it has done anything (see figure 3).<br><br>

					<b>RSO product type usage</b><br><br>
					There are different type of RSO products available with different strengths. Two active components of RSO are widely used for their benefits. Both types are used for different conditions. Type I component is classified as a low to intermediate effect and used for stress, sleep, epilepsy, Alzheimer, PTSD, MS and more, while the type II component is classified as a strong RSO effect and often used with more severe conditions, to relief pain and chemo relief.<br><br>

					41,6% of the patients used a RSO product that contained both active components, 25,5% of the patients used mainly products with the type I component (low to intermediate effect) and 30,7% used a product with mainly the type II component (strong effect). 2,2% was not sure what RSO product they had used (see figure 6).<br><br>
					</p>

					<i>Figure 6. RSO used by all patients. Type I component is classified as a strong RSO effect. Type II component is classified as a low to intermediate RSO effect. Both types are used for different conditions.</i><br><br>

					45,2% of the cancer patients used a RSO product that contained both active components. 12,9% of these patients used mainly products with the type I and 38,7% used a product with mainly the type II component. 3,6% was not sure what RSO product they had used (see figure 7).<br><br>

					<i>Figure 7. RSO used by patients with cancer.</i><br><br>

					44,4% of the patients, that mentioned to use it for pain relief, used a RSO product that contained both active components. 22,2% of these patients used mainly products with type I and 33,3% used a product with mainly type II (see figure 8).<br><br>

					<i>Figure 8. RSO used by patients with pain.</i><br><br>

					47,1% of the 16 patients, that mentioned to use it for either depression, stress relief or anxiety, used a RSO product that contained active components. 29,4% of these patients used mainly products with type I component and 23,5% used a product with mainly the type II component (see figure 9).<br><br>

					<p>
					<i>Figure 9. RSO used by patients with stress/depression/anxiety.</i><br><br>

					A recent 2020 study found that RSO improves blood flow to parts of the brain associated with memory and decision-making. MRI scans showed type II increased blood flow to the hippocampus, responsible for memories and the orbitofrontal cortex, responsible for decision-making. Researchers say the findings could be an important discovery for conditions which affect memory, such as Alzheimer's disease and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and could help better target therapies.<br><br>

					Table 1 below shows the average responses of patients that used RSO products for other health conditions.<br>

					We (this website) collect some data if you use our contact form, your email address and name is saved in order for us to send you a reply with more information. We'll never share your email or name with anyone else.
					When you leave a comment on this site, then we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also collect the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment. [Cookies] If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year. If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser. When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed. Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites (e.g. Youtube, Trustpilot, Facebook) may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.We do not sell, lease, rent or otherwise disclose your personal data to third parties. We'll never share your email or name with anyone else. If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information. If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
